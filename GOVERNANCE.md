## Overview

This document outlines a set of policies in order to provide a level playing field and open process for contributors to join the OpenFGA project.

Governance activities are currently performed manually. In the future we might use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or similar technology to automate tasks, but we're currently a small team and iterating quickly - for now it makes sense to do things in a way that doesn't scale.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Members participating in the OpenFGA project have different roles and responsibilities.

* Core members
* Product
* Maintainers
* Contributors

#### Core

Core members are involved with the codebase and technical implementation details of the product, collaborating together on a variety of aspects such as the core server, APIs, documentation, SDKs, CLI & tooling, and more.

*Responsibilities include:*
- Review RFCs (OpenFGA Request for Comments) or delegate their review to a more relevant team
- Reach consensus and usher each RFC through the resolution process
- Collaborate with the community to collect feedback for RFCs
- Ensure RFCs are acceptable to maintain
- Govern OpenFGA repos
- PR review and merging
- Curating releases
- Receive security reports, triage them, and respond in accordance to the [Security Policy](https://github.com/openfga/community/security/policy)
- Core members are also [maintainers](#maintainers)

Secondary priorities involve collaborating with @product on the roadmap, user research, and iterating on the product experience.

#### Product

The @product team is focused on product value and delivering iterative improvements of the product. They govern the product roadmap, product marketing, design principles, user research, and overall product experience.

*Responsibilities include:*
- Develop and iterate on the governance model
- Review RFCs or delegate their review to a more relevant team
- Maintain OpenFGA's design principles through the RFC review process
- Clarify OpenFGA's design principles over time
- Collaborate with core members to develop a roadmap that fits OpenFGA's design principles
- Collaborate with core members and maintainers on user research
- Iterate on the product experience

#### Maintainers

[Maintainers](https://github.com/openfga/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) consist of users who can contribute _and_ approve PRs. They help to ensure contributions align with the project's goals, facilitate collaboration, and maintain the quality of contributions.

*Responsibilities include:*
- Contribute based on backlog items
- Review incoming PRs and ensure they meet project standards
- Participate in discussions for features and provide feedback
- Consult with other members to clarify requirements
- Collaborate with the core members or other maintainers on technical feasibility and implementation details
- Provide input to the @product team based on community feedback

#### Contributors

Anyone can become a contributor by contributing code, issues or ideas to the product. Any of the following activites qualify as a contribution:

- Opening a GitHub issue to report a problem or feature request.
- If you would like to also fix the problem, explain your proposed solution for and note that you would like to work on it.
- Engage in a discussion with a maintainer and/or solicit community feedback.
- After agreement how to proceed, submit a PR for review.
- Typos, or small "one-liner" fixes do not require GitHub issues. Feel free to directly create a PR.

## Governance-Related Policies and Procedures

Decisions regarding any of the processes or policies outlined in this Governance model are reached through consensus among the team members through a 66%+ supermajority unless otherwise expressly stated through the team's own processes.

Voting can be expressed through pull request review, leaving a comment, or through some other form of record - ideally permanent.

### Amending the Governance Model

Nothing here is set in stone. Please improve this document as necessary. Pull requests to this process (`GOVERNANCE.md`) will be reviewed by the core membership and @product teams.
